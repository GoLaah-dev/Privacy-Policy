Validation of your GoLaah account
We validate the accounts of GoLaah users by using SMS verification to ensure that each account is associated with a real and unique user. This validation process is initiated once you proceed with posting your first ad listing on our Services. In order to validate your GoLaah account before posting your ad listing, we will send you an SMS on a valid mobile number provided by you. This process is entirely free of charge. If you do not agree to validate your account, then your account will remain active and you will be able to use our Services with limited functionality. This limited functionality of an account implies that you cannot publish new ad listings or edit, update, promote, extend, reactivate, deactivate or delete existing ad listings until your account is verified by SMS. You will also not be able to receive or reply to any messages from other users.
In case you create several GoLaah accounts using the same mobile number and validate all those accounts via SMS verification, all such accounts will have a limited functionality and you will be asked to choose one of them. The account chosen by you will return to full functionality, and the rest of the accounts will remain to have limited functionality.
Every user can request a maximum of 5 SMS messages with verification codes, within 24 hours. Account validation is done only once for each account, until it is successfully verified via SMS by the user.
Once you have validated your GoLaah, it will remain associated with the mobile number used for the SMS verification. If you wish to change the mobile number associated with your GoLaah account, you will need to contact our Customer Support team.
